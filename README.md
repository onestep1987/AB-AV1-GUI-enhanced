# A Python AB-AV1 GUI

A lean, cross-platform [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html)-based GUI for intelligently reducing the footprint of your video library by converting to [AV1](https://aomedia.org/av1/), with some bells & whistles.  

> [!NOTE]
> **v2 Breaking Changes:** The config and history file formats have changed. Existing `av1_converter_config.json` and `conversion_history.json` files will be reset on first launch.  

## Premise

The AV1 video codec offers incredible gains for most video types vs standard [x264](https://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html) and [x265](https://www.videolan.org/developers/x265.html) encoded files. However, letting [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) rip through a project without tweaking parameters on a per-video basis produces terrible results. 

This tool mainly acts as a wrapper for the incredible cli tool [ab-av1](https://github.com/alexheretic/ab-av1), which randomly samples each video with varying parameters, efficiently discovering the right parameters to achieve maximum filesize reduction for your configured visual fidelity score (defaults to 95%). Ab-av1's magic is using the [VMAF](https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf) algorithm from Netflix for analyzing visual fidelity based on metrics which mirror human perception rather than statistical similarity. The tool then runs the conversion for the set parameters with FFmpeg.

## Features

- **VMAF-based quality targeting:** targets visual quality (_default: **95**_) instead of guessing bitrates
- **Queue-based workflow:** add files or folders, preview estimates, process sequentially  
- **Private, secure, safe:** no pip packages, no telemetry, optional anonymization of history/logs
- **Estimate tuning:** continually improves estimates using your own conversion history (based on resolution, duration, and codec)

## Usage

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.11+ ([Ensure your install includes Tkinter](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76105218/why-does-tkinter-or-turtle-seem-to-be-missing-or-broken-shouldnt-it-be-part), included by default on Windows and MacOS).         
- **Optional:** [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) with libsvtav1 and [ab-av1](https://github.com/alexheretic/ab-av1/releases) may be pre-installed system-wide and available in PATH. Or download portable binaries in-app.  


On Windows, double-click `convert.bat`. On Linux/macOS, run `./convert.sh`.

If FFmpeg or ab-av1 are missing, download them from the Settings tab.  

## Notes

- Output is always MKV container (best AV1 compatibility).
- Tested on Windows. Designed for cross-platform but Linux/macOS are untested. Known limitation: sleep prevention during conversion is Windows-only.
- **Media servers**: Be thoughtful about support for AV1 decoding in devices you want to watch video on. Old phones, PCs, streamers, and smart TVs may not support it, adding a high computational burden for transcoding on the server.  
- ** 媒体服务器 **：在你想观看视频的设备上，要考虑支持 AV1 解码。老旧手机、个人电脑、流媒体播放器和智能电视可能不支持，这会给服务器上的转码增加较高的计算负担。
